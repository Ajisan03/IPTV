# IPTV

Hi all, this is just a public list I compile in my hobby time. Feel free to fork or take whatever you want. I hope you all will be inspired to make more tidy playlists of your own. 

## Usage

All the M3U-playlist is very very experimental at the moment. The GoCast playlists is a public list of every link I have collect so far. No gurantee the link over there will work. Drop me a email if any of the links is not working. I don't expect any people to share their links although you are welcome too.

At the moment I maintain three playlists at the GoCast2 section for an Malaysian/Singaporean audience:

- https://iptv-org.github.io/IPTV/GoCast2/Oriental/Gugong.m3u8 (Orient focused playlist - Chinese, Korean, Japanese)
- https://iptv-org.github.io/IPTV/GoCast2/Oriental/Istana.m3u8 (Malay focused playlist - Malaysia, Indonesia, Major Thai/Arab TV   Channel)
- https://iptv-org.github.io/IPTV/GoCast2/Oriental/Mahal.m3u8 (Indian focused playlist - More Hindi, Bengali, Urdu, Malayalam, Punjabi, Tamil AKA the Big 6 Indian Languages)

And an very very very very very very experiemental EPG:

## Complaints FAQ

1. If link is down, do drop me a message. I have a day job too, so don't expect any quick support unless you want donate money or servers to me. 

2. I don't sell or trade IPTV list. If I don't share a link, it is because it does not work for me.

3. Be considerate and civilised

4. PLEASE don't rely it as your daily iptv day or use this list for your business. I change the contents of playlist all the time. So your channel goes missing, chances are that they link can't work for me and you.

5. Some of the link (especially the Geo-Restricted link) can be play with tivimate without the need for a VPN. So if it can't be play with other iptv program, do consider using tivimate. 

6. For sports channel lover, please support your cable tv provider. Their streams are the best, no doubt. 

7. None of the links is my work. I just choose to share my private tv collection of links.
